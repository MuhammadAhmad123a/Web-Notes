Hello you and welcome to your challenge.

00:04.480 --> 00:10.100
So in this challenge module you will be building a game that is modeled off the game.

00:10.100 --> 00:17.620
SIMON So the way that it works is that you can press any key to start and it will show you a pile that

00:17.620 --> 00:18.560
you have to click on.

00:18.910 --> 00:27.760
And as you go from level to level the to get more and more complicated and at some point you're going

00:27.760 --> 00:28.300
to.

00:28.800 --> 00:31.040
And it's going to tell you that you got it wrong.

00:31.180 --> 00:32.310
And game is over.

00:32.320 --> 00:35.540
So you can press any key to restart the game.

00:35.560 --> 00:39.760
So this is going to be a challenge but it's also going to be really really fun and it's going to test

00:39.760 --> 00:45.520
out your skills and what you've learned in the last module on Jay Querrey as well as some of the modules

00:45.520 --> 00:47.560
that we have tackled previously.

00:47.560 --> 00:49.110
So once you're ready.

00:49.180 --> 00:53.890
Head over to the next set of lessons where you'll find the instructions as well as the start of code

00:54.220 --> 00:56.170
for your challenge.

00:56.170 --> 00:59.360
So I wish you the best of luck and I'll see you on the other side.
